# Styling the project

To style the project **DO NOT TOUCH** the original **APP.CSS** file

Do any kind of changes to the scss file

-   Make a new file start the file name with **\_<filename>.scss** followed by the file name.
-   Attach the new file with the main **App.scss** file
    with **@import "\_filename";**
-
